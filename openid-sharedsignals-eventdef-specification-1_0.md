--- abstract

This document defines how to describe events for the Shared Signals Framework {{SSF}} using JSON Schema. It specifies how to translate normative requirements for event types into JSON Schema vocabulary and the process to register and discover new schemas.

--- middle

# Introduction {#introduction}

Shared Signals Framework {{SSF}} enables sharing of signals and events between cooperating peers. {{SSF}} can be profiled for different applications as event types, such as Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination {{RISC}} and the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile {{CAEP}}.

This specification defines how to translate normative SSF event requirements into a JSON Schema. JSON Schema is a standardized way to describe the structure, constraints, and data types within a JSON document. JSON Schemas can also be used as validators to automatically check if a JSON document adheres to the defined schema, ensuring data integrity.

Using JSON Schema to describe SSF has three main benefits. First, it enables a faster process to create, update and get approval for new event types. Second, JSON schema, rather than spec texts, is a more appropriate format to describe event types. And lastly, it allows event types to be versioned independently thus reducing the friction between the SSF core specification and event type publication.

# JSON Schema Defintion

Schema keywords - Normative
Validation keywords - Normative
Schema annotations - Non-normative


\\$schema
: REQUIRED, JSON string: URI of the version of JSON Schema that this document adheres to. E.g., `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`. Normative Schema Keyword.

\\$id
: REQUIRED, JSON string: URI of the schema. SHOULD be publicly accessible and resolve to the JSON Schema document. Normative Schema Keyword.

title
: REQUIRED, JSON string: Title of the schema. Informational Schema Annotation.

description
: REQUIRED, JSON string: Intent of the schema. Informational Schema Annotation.

type
: REQUIRED JSON string: Defines the first constraint on the JSON data. MUST be "object". Normative Validation Keyword.

properties
: REQUIRED JSON object: Object that defines the keys in the JSON data that are being validated. Normative Validation Keyword.


~~~ json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked/v1.schema.json",
  "title": "Session Revoked",
  "description": "Session Revoked signals that the session identified by the subject has been revoked. The explicit session identifier may be directly referenced in the subject or other properties of the session may be included to allow the receiver to identify applicable sessions.",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {}
 }
~~~

## Properties 

 
> ### Open Questions:
> - Should the schema contain just validate the events claim in the SET? 
>   - Typically you'd use another JWT library to validate the top level claims like iss, aud, etc.


The top level "properties" key contains an object "where each property represents a key in the JSON data thatâ€™s being validated." (https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step. Within each property, all normative requirements and non-normative details are specified, such as a description of the property, if its required, what values are allowed, etc.

The properties key MUST follow the vocabulary specified in {{JSONSchemaValidation}}

~~~json
{
   "properties": {
    "initiating_entity": {
      "description": "Describes the entity that invoked the event.",
      "type": "string",
      "oneOf": [
        {
          "const": "admin",
          "description": "an administrative action triggered the event"
        },
        {
          "const": "user",
          "description": "an end-user action triggered the event"
        },
        {
          "const": "policy",
          "description": "a policy evaluation triggered the event"
        },
        {
          "const": "system",
          "description": "a system or platform assertion triggered the event"
        }
      ]
    },
    "required": [ "initiating_entity" ]
   }
}

## Notational Considerations
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
