--- abstract

This document defines how to describe events for the Shared Signals Framework {{SSF}} using JSON Schema. It specifies how to translate normative requirements for event types into JSON Schema vocabulary and the process to register and discover new schemas.

--- middle

# Introduction {#introduction}

The Shared Signals Framework {{SSF}} enables sharing of signals and events between cooperating peers. It is currently leveraged by two applications â€“ the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile {{CAEP}} and Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination {{RISC}}.

This specification defines how to translate normative SSF event requirements, such as from CAEP and RISC events, into a JSON Schema. {{JSONSchema}} is a standardized way to describe the structure, constraints, and data types within a JSON document. JSON Schemas are often used with {{JSONSchemaValidation}} to automatically check if a JSON document adheres to the defined schema, thus ensuring data integrity.

Using JSON Schema to describe SSF has the following benefits:
- Faster process to create, update and get approval for new event types
- Easy and appropriate format to describe event types, as opposed to traditional specification text
- Machine readability for creating and validating SSF event paylods
- Independent versioning to reduce the friction between the SSF core specification and event type publications
- Allows new SSF events to be incorporated into the SSF ecosystem

# JSON Schema Defintion

The following section describes how to map a SSF event to a JSON Schema Document.

As defined in Section 4.3 of {{JSON Schema}}, a JSON Schema document, also called a "schema", is a JSON document used to describe another JSON document, known as an instance.

A JSON Schema document describes the instance of SSF SET event "payload" (Section 2 of {{SET}}). As such, the schema will define the claims that pertain to the specific SSF event type. The $id for the schema document MUST be the same as the event identifier of the SET.

The schema is made up of the following top-level JSON keys:

\\$schema
: REQUIRED, JSON string: URI of the version of JSON Schema that this document adheres to. E.g., `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`. Normative Schema Keyword.

\\$id
: REQUIRED, JSON string: URI of the schema, also known as the Event Identifier of the SET appended in accordance with[Schema Ids](#schema-ids). MUST be publicly accessible or available out-of-band and resolve to JSON Schema document. Normative Schema Keyword.

title
: REQUIRED, JSON string: Title of the schema. Informational Schema Annotation.

description
: REQUIRED, JSON string: Intent of the schema. Informational Schema Annotation.

type
: REQUIRED JSON string: Defines the first constraint on the JSON data. MUST be "object". Normative Validation Keyword.

properties
: REQUIRED JSON object: Object that defines the keys in the JSON data that are being validated. Normative Validation Keyword.


The following is a non-normative example of the top level properties of a JSON Schema document for a Session Revoked CAEP event.
~~~ json
{
   "$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
   "$id":"https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked/1.0.0/schema.json",
   "title":"Session Revoked",
   "description":"Session Revoked signals that the session identified by the subject has been revoked. The explicit session identifier may be directly referenced in the subject or other properties of the session may be included to allow the receiver to identify applicable sessions.",
   "type":"object",
   "properties":{...}
}
~~~

## Properties 

The top level "properties" key contains an object where each property represents a key in the JSON data being validated. Within each property, all normative requirements and non-normative details are specified by using the vocabulary in {{JSONSchemaValidation}}.

The following is a non-normative example of a "properties" object for a CAEP event schema.
~~~json
{
   "properties": {
    "initiating_entity": {
      "description": "Describes the entity that invoked the event.",
      "type": "string",
      "oneOf": [
        {
          "const": "admin",
          "description": "an administrative action triggered the event"
        },
        {
          "const": "user",
          "description": "an end-user action triggered the event"
        },
        {
          "const": "policy",
          "description": "a policy evaluation triggered the event"
        },
        {
          "const": "system",
          "description": "a system or platform assertion triggered the event"
        }
      ]
    },
    "required": [ "initiating_entity" ]
   }
}
~~~

            }

      },
      "event_timestamp":{
         "type":"number"
      }
   }
}

# Registry

## Schema Ids

Ids of SSF event schemas MUST adhere the following convention:

{event type URI}/{semantic version}/schema.json

For example, the schema id for a session revoked caep event would be constructed by concatenating the following:
- event type uri: https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked
- semantic version: 1.0.0
- schema.json

The resulting id would be "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked/1.0.0/schema.json"


## The Registration Process

SSF Implementers may find that existing registered SSF event types do not meet the needs of their applications. In that case, they may propose a new SSF event type and register its schema. To do so, an implementer MUST create a request in the form of a Pull Request to https://github.com/openid/sharedsignals following the PR Template and meeting the following requirements. The pull request will be reviewed by the Shared Signals Working Group and accepted at their discretion.

1. Author(s) of the pull request MUST be at least a contributing member of the OpenID Foundation.
1. The Pull Request MUST contain a human readable description of the new SSF event type.
1. The $id of the schema MUST be publicly accessible on the internet and resolve to the schema document.
1. The "title" and "description" of the schema must be meaningful and indicative of its function.
1. The naming of all schema properties MUST be indicative of its function.
1. Schemas should not be removed, only incremented (via semantic versioning) or marked as deprecated in the repositiory. Any changes to schemas must follow semantic versioning.

## Notational Considerations
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
